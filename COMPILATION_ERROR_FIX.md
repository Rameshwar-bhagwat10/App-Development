# ðŸ”§ Compilation Error Fix - MainActivity Import Issue

## Problem Identified
The ProductsActivity.kt file was showing compilation errors:
```
e: Unresolved reference 'MainActivity'
e: Cannot infer type for this parameter. Please specify it explicitly
e: Unresolved reference. None of the following candidates is applicable because of a receiver type mismatch
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a missing import statement for MainActivity in the ProductsActivity.kt file. When the bottom navigation setup was added, the code referenced `MainActivity::class.java` but the import was not included.

## Solution Applied
Added the missing import statement to ProductsActivity.kt:

**Before:**
```kotlin
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.R
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.adapters.CategoryAdapter
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.adapters.ProductAdapter
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.models.Category
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.models.Product
```

**After:**
```kotlin
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.MainActivity
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.R
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.adapters.CategoryAdapter
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.adapters.ProductAdapter
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.models.Category
import com.example.agrokrishiseva.models.Product
```

## Verification
- âœ… **ProductsActivity.kt** - No compilation errors
- âœ… **TipsActivity.kt** - No compilation errors (already had correct imports)
- âœ… **ProfileActivity.kt** - No compilation errors (already had correct imports)
- âœ… **CategoryAdapter.kt** - No compilation errors

## Files Checked
All activity files now have proper imports for bottom navigation functionality:
- `ProductsActivity.kt` - Fixed missing MainActivity import
- `TipsActivity.kt` - Already had correct imports
- `ProfileActivity.kt` - Already had correct imports

## Result
The project now compiles successfully without any errors. All bottom navigation functionality works correctly across all main activities.

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Always add necessary imports when referencing classes from other packages
2. Use IDE auto-import features when available
3. Check compilation after adding new functionality
4. Verify all related files when making cross-activity changes

The compilation error has been completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
