# ðŸ”§ XML Tag Closing Issue Fixed - activity_products.xml

## Problem Identified
The activity_products.xml file had a tag closing issue where there was an extra `</LinearLayout>` closing tag that didn't match any opening tag.

## Root Cause
During the enhancement of the product header card, an extra closing tag was accidentally added, causing the XML structure to be invalid.

## Location of Issue
The problem was in the Enhanced Header Card section around line 225, where there were three consecutive closing `</LinearLayout>` tags when only two were needed.

## Solution Applied
**Before (Incorrect):**
```xml
                    </LinearLayout>

                </LinearLayout>

            </LinearLayout>
```

**After (Fixed):**
```xml
                    </LinearLayout>

            </LinearLayout>
```

## Verification
- âœ… **XML Validation** - No more syntax errors
- âœ… **Diagnostics Check** - No compilation issues found
- âœ… **Structure Integrity** - All opening tags now have matching closing tags
- âœ… **Layout Functionality** - Enhanced header card maintains all styling and functionality

## Result
The activity_products.xml file now has proper XML structure with:
- Correct tag nesting and closing
- All enhanced styling preserved
- Interactive elements functioning properly
- No compilation errors

The XML tag closing issue has been completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
